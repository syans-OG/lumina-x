# Project Concept: "Lumina X" - Audiophile Experience
> **Theme:** Luxury, Minimalist, Metallic, Smooth.
> **Goal:** Create an award-winning scrolling experience while learning React/Next.js.

## 🧠 Multi-Agent Design Review

### 1. Product Agent (The User Advocate)
*   **Perspective:** "The user is new to React. We cannot overwhelm them with complex state management or backend logic."
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Strictly **One Page** (Single Page Application). No complex routing.
    *   Focus on **Presentation** over Logic.
    *   Use ready-made 3D assets (free high-quality models) to save time for coding.
    *   **MVP:** Header, Hero (3D), Features (Scroll), and Footer.

### 2. Creative Agent (The Art Director)
*   **Perspective:** "It needs to look expensive. Think Apple, Sony, Bang & Olufsen."
*   **Visual Direction:**
    *   **Palette:**
        *   Background: Deep Charcoal (#0a0a0a) or Pure White (depending on mode, let's go Dark Mode for premium feel).
        *   Accents: Brushed Titanium, Electric Blue (for lighting), White text.
    *   **Typography:** 'Inter' or 'Outfit' (Clean Sans-serif). Thin weights for elegance.
    *   **Motion:** Slow, dampened ease (ease-out-expo). No bouncy animations.

### 3. Tech Agent (The Architect)
*   **Perspective:** "Next.js is the framework. R3F is the tool. Performance is key."
*   **Stack Strategy:**
    *   **Next.js 14+ (App Router):** Modern standard.
    *   **Tailwind CSS:** For rapid layout.
    *   **React Three Fiber (R3F):** For the 3D scene.
    *   **Drei:** Library of R3F helpers (makes 3D easy).
    *   **GSAP:** For the scroll triggers.
*   **Risk:** 3D models can be heavy. We must optimize textures.

## 🗺️ Project Roadmap (The Learning Path)

### Phase 1: The Foundation (React 101)
*   Setup Next.js & Tailwind.
*   Understanding Components: Breaking the UI into chunks (Navbar, Hero, Section).
*   Basic Styling: "Making it look good static".

### Phase 2: The Dimension (3D World)
*   Intro to React Three Fiber.
*   Loading a glorious Headphone model (GLTF).
*   Lighting & Environment (The "Studio Setup").

### Phase 3: The Magic (Animation)
*   Connecting Scroll to Animation (GSAP ScrollTrigger).
*   Moving the camera around the headset as user scrolls.
*   Exploding the view (parts separation).

### Phase 4: The Polish (Micro-interactions)
*   Custom smooth cursor.
*   Hover effects.
*   Loading screen.

## 🎨 Color Palette (Theme Factory)
*   **Canvas:** `#050505` (Almost Black)
*   **Surface:** `#1A1A1A` (Dark Grey)
*   **Primary:** `#E0E0E0` (Titanium White)
*   **Accent:** `#2563EB` (International Klein Blue - for LEDs/Highlights)
